Stages of Compiler Design:

1.Lexical Analysis: The first stage of compiler design is lexical analysis, also known as scanning. In this stage, the compiler reads the source code character by character and breaks it down into a series of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators. These tokens are then passed on to the next stage of the compilation process.

2.Syntax Analysis: The second stage of compiler design is syntax analysis, also known as parsing. In this stage, the compiler checks the syntax of the source code to ensure that it conforms to the rules of the programming language. The compiler builds a parse tree, which is a hierarchical representation of the programâ€™s structure, and uses it to check for syntax errors.
Semantic Analysis: The third stage of compiler design is semantic analysis. In this stage, the compiler checks the meaning of the source code to ensure that it makes sense. The compiler performs type checking, which ensures that variables are used correctly and that operations are performed on compatible data types. The compiler also checks for other semantic errors, such as undeclared variables and incorrect function calls.

3.Code Generation: The fourth stage of compiler design is code generation. In this stage, the compiler translates the parse tree into machine code that can be executed by the computer. The code generated by the compiler must be efficient and optimized for the target platform.

4.Optimization: The final stage of compiler design is optimization. In this stage, the compiler analyzes the generated code and makes optimizations to improve its performance. The compiler may perform optimizations such as constant folding, loop unrolling, and function inlining.
